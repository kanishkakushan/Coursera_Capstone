Kolkata is a pioneer in the field of drama, arts, theatre and literature with several nobel laureates contributing to the Kolkata culture. But one thing people seems to forget about is the food of Kolkata. Somewhere between Rossogollas and lip-smacking fish preparations, many rich Bengali delicacies go unnoticed. And one such delicacy is the Kolkata Biryani. One can also blame the greater popularity of its southern counterpart - Hyderabadi Biryani, which might have for long prevented the Kolkata Biryani to flourish in all its glory. But Kolkata Biryani is slowly working its way out of the canals of the City of Joy and gaining the due recognition it has long deserved."
